<p>In my teens I once wanted to install Linux on my Windows Gaming machine. A friend of my father was a Linux user and had given me an installation CD. I installed it and found myself disappointed: The gaming support was very poor and since that was all I was interested in, I saw no point in using it.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovering-gnu-linux">Rediscovering GNU/Linux<a href="#rediscovering-gnu-linux" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>But in 2019, driven by a desire to use open source software, I got interested in Linux again. After testing it for a while on an older computer, I finally made the switch and got myself a <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/">Tuxedo Computer</a>.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the operating system and distributions had come a long way since my earlier experience. For instance, nowadays Steam in combination with <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">Proton</a> allows for many games to be played on Linux.</p>
<p>For some time I used the pre-installed TuxedoOS distribution, but then curiousity got me.</p>
<h2 id="distro-hopping-and-landing-on-manjaro">Distro hopping and landing on Manjaro<a href="#distro-hopping-and-landing-on-manjaro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I installed and tried various flavors, like Mint and Kubuntu, but eventually made my way to the Arch-based Manjaro. My journey taught me a lot about computers, like &ldquo;What is a kernel?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is a package manager?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I use <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> with a combination of KDE as the desktop manager and qtile as a window manager.</p>

<p>What I absolutely love about my setup is that I can customize it however I want. While it is time consuming and sometimes frustrating, I find that in the end I get rewarded not only by a feeling of accomplishment, but also by a sleek and well-fitted computing experience.</p>
<p>Linux offers many advantages and once one becomes familiar with them, they can be leveraged to great effect. For example, I have all my <code>dotfiles</code> (configs for <code>rofi</code>, <code>qtile</code>, <code>zsh</code>, <code>doom</code>) in one repository with systemlinks to their appropriate config folders. This way I have a central point for my system config, can easily back it up and deploy it on other machines. Powered by open source tools.</p>
<h2 id="why-yes-of-course-i-floss">&ldquo;Why, yes, of course I FLOSS&rdquo;<a href="#why-yes-of-course-i-floss" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Over time I have developed a burning fashion for Free and Open Source Software (FLOSS). Often times it means going out of my way to get something to work. But, in the end I have a deeper understanding of the stuff I&rsquo;m using and hold the reigns myself.</p>
<p>I truly believe that FLOSS can lead to a more free and just world.</p>
