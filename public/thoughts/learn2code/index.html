        <h2 id="my-helloworld-experience">My HelloWorld Experience<a href="#my-helloworld-experience" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Growing up, I have always been interested in computers. My passion was mostly playing computer games. But as long as everything was working, I did not look under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="java">Java<a href="#java" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>When I was 13 or so, my father gave a &ldquo;Java 6 for Dummies&rdquo; book to me. I tried the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;, but just the setup process of the IDE in Windows was too cumbersome for me. The syntax was not looking welcoming either (<em>&ldquo;How do create these curly braces again?!&quot;</em>).</p>
<p>So, I gave up and did not pursue Java further.</p>
<h2 id="ruby">Ruby<a href="#ruby" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>While doing an internship in 2016 at a Berlin start-up, I got fascinated by the idea of writing code again.</p>
<p>This time I picked up Ruby on Rails and went through an online course by <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">TeamTreehouse</a>. Ruby showed me that the syntax did not have to complex, but I was lacking a usecase to practise.</p>
<p>Also, my general knowledge of computers was lacking and doing everything around the actual code writing threw me off once more.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python<a href="#python" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>During my time as a journalist at <a href="https://www.btc-echo.de/author/alexander-roos/">BTC-ECHO</a> in 2018, I was learning a lot about <a href="/thoughts/crypto/">Cryptocurrencies and Cryptography</a>. The tech space simply fascinated me. The idea started to grow, that instead of simply sitting on the sidelines and reporting on the developments, I could be a part of the community of people &ldquo;actually doing something&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that around the same time, the hashtag <code>#learn2code</code> was going around on Twitter. And yes, it all made sense: Technology is the future, and I should be able to actually use it.</p>
<p>But this time I did some research first: What languages are in demand? What&rsquo;s a good computer language to start with? The answer for me was <a href="#python">Python</a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-comfortable-with-computers">Getting comfortable with computers<a href="#getting-comfortable-with-computers" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So I took the #learn2code hashtag to heart and started teaching myself to code in summer of 2019. By then I knew much more about computers and quickly found myself enjoying the learning process.</p>
<p>Soon after - towards the end of 2019 - I ditched my MacBook Pro for a <a href="/thoughts/linux/">GNU/Linux</a> machine. Gradually, I familiarised myself with the UNIX system and philosophy.</p>
<p>A big step was working through the book &ldquo;<a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff</a>&rdquo;, since it provided an immediate use-case for my everyday life.</p>

<h2 id="what-has-kept-me-going">What has kept me going<a href="#what-has-kept-me-going" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>As any programmer may attest to: there are moments, where the program just won&rsquo;t work. Hours upon hours are spent looking through StackOverflow, until suddenly: <strong>it works</strong>. This feeling of overcoming the struggle, and making something work has kept me hooked on writing code.</p>
<p>Another big plus is the utility, which can be created. It&rsquo;s not only fun coding, you actually get something back from it.</p>
