      <description>The first RaspberryPi I bought was for my own Bitcoin/Lightning-Network node (RaspiBlitz). Building this project was a great learning experience and it introduced me to the idea of self-hosted software services.
Using the RaspberryPi One of the first real use-cases I found for a RaspberryPi was to host my Telegram Bots. Since they require the running computer to be always online. Therefore, my solution to hosting bots written in Python is to create a service on the Pi that executes the main script on start-up.</description>
