      <description>The first RaspberryPi I bought was for my own Bitcoin/Lightning-Network node (RaspiBlitz). Building this project was a great learning experience and it introduced me to the idea of self-hosted software services.
Using the RaspberryPi One of the first real use-cases I found for a RaspberryPi was to host my Telegram Bots. Since they require the running computer to be always online. Therefore, my solution to hosting bots written in Python is to create a service on the Pi that executes the main script on start-up.</description>

      <description>My HelloWorld Experience Growing up, I have always been interested in computers. My passion was mostly playing computer games. But as long as everything was working, I did not look under the hood.
Java When I was 13 or so, my father gave a &amp;ldquo;Java 6 for Dummies&amp;rdquo; book to me. I tried the &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;, but just the setup process of the IDE in Windows was too cumbersome for me.</description>

      <description>Check the code out on GitHub!
 Here I have 3 different Python scripts that automate certain aspects of my workflows.
delete_txts.py When I coded my first lyrics grabber for iTunes, I had saved the lyrics for all songs in the album direcotry as a .txt.
