      <description>My HelloWorld Experience Growing up, I have always been interested in computers. My passion was mostly playing computer games. But as long as everything was working, I did not look under the hood.
Java When I was 13 or so, my father gave a &amp;ldquo;Java 6 for Dummies&amp;rdquo; book to me. I tried the &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;, but just the setup process of the IDE in Windows was too cumbersome for me.</description>

 Using programming skills for real world value In the summer of 2020 I was working as an editor in chief for the German section of BeInCrypto. While the work as a journalist and editor was certainly interesting and rewarding, by that time the passion to code had me already. So I wanted to program something that would be useful to the business.</description>

 My first real programm When I worked through &amp;ldquo;Automate the Boring Stuff&amp;rdquo;, I wanted to keep track of my time invested in learning Python. So the idea for a timetracker with a command line interface was born.
It was a great exercise, because my knowledge on the first version was very limited. I did not use a database, but instead an Excel-Sheet, where I would automate the input into the cells, and read the cells to calculate my total time invested.</description>

 Playing with APIs The purpose of this bot was for me to practice using public APIs. Allthewhile I also wanted to provide some value to Monero ethusiasts on Telegram.
For this I used API provided by MoneroBlocks.info (nowadays LocalMonero.co). With the right parameters in the URL you get a json object with the appropriate information (i.e. Block Height, TXs in the last Block etc.</description>

      <description>Falling in love with programming Python was the first computer language that I studied seriously. Over time I have fallen in love with the Zen of Python and learned a lot about broader principles of coding.
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense.</description>

 Here I have 3 different Python scripts that automate certain aspects of my workflows.
delete_txts.py When I coded my first lyrics grabber for iTunes, I had saved the lyrics for all songs in the album direcotry as a .txt.
This was not necessary, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me much at first. However, since my library contains around 7.000 songs, I also had 7.</description>

 My first real telegram bot Since I was an admin in a particular Telegram group, I wanted to use my programming knowledge to expand the utility of my group. Soon after, the idea for a Reddit-style voting bot for messages was born.
Basically, users have voting power that gets reset every 24 hours. Up- or downvoting consumes voting power. Users collect repuation over time and can &amp;ldquo;win the week&amp;rdquo;, meaning that they are the user with the most upvotes in a given week.</description>
