## First contact with Linux {#first-contact-with-linux}

In my teens I once wanted to install Linux on my Windows Gaming machine. A friend of my father was a Linux user and had given me an installation CD. I installed it and found myself disappointed: The gaming support was very poor and since that was all I was interested in, I saw no point in using it.

## Rediscovering GNU/Linux {#rediscovering-gnu-linux}

But in 2019, driven by a desire to use open source software, I got interested in Linux again. After testing it for a while on an older computer, I finally made the switch and got myself a [Tuxedo Computer](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/).

It was obvious that the operating system and distributions had come a long way since my earlier experience. For instance, nowadays Steam in combination with [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/) allows for many games to be played on Linux.

For some time I used the pre-installed TuxedoOS distribution, but then curiousity got me.

## Distro hopping and landing on Manjaro {#distro-hopping-and-landing-on-manjaro}

I installed and tried various flavors, like Mint and Kubuntu, but eventually made my way to the Arch-based Manjaro. My journey taught me a lot about computers, like "What is a kernel?" or "What is a package manager?".

At the time of writing, I use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) with a combination of KDE as the desktop manager and qtile as a window manager.

## The little things... {#the-little-things-dot-dot-dot}

What I absolutely love about my setup is that I can customize it however I want. While it is time consuming and sometimes frustrating, I find that in the end I get rewarded not only by a feeling of accomplishment, but also by a sleek and well-fitted computing experience.

Linux offers many advantages and once one becomes familiar with them, they can be leveraged to great effect. For example, I have all my `dotfiles` (configs for `rofi`, `qtile`, `zsh`, `doom`) in one repository with systemlinks to their appropriate config folders. This way I have a central point for my system config, can easily back it up and deploy it on other machines. Powered by open source tools.

## "Why, yes, of course I FLOSS" {#why-yes-of-course-i-floss}

Over time I have developed a burning fashion for Free and Open Source Software (FLOSS). Often times it means going out of my way to get something to work. But, in the end I have a deeper understanding of the stuff I'm using and hold the reigns myself.

I truly believe that FLOSS can lead to a more free and just world.
