## First contact with Linux {#first-contact-with-linux}

During my teens, before my advances with computers, I once wanted to install Linux on my Windows Gaming machine. A friend of my father was a Linux user and had given me an installation CD. But since Linux did not suppport many of the games I wanted to play, I saw no point in using it.

## Rediscovering GNU/Linux {#rediscovering-gnu-linux}

Driven by a desire to use open source software, I got interested in Linux around 2019 again. After testing it for a while on an older computer, I finally made the switch and got myself a [Tuxedo Computer](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/).

It was obvious that the operating systems had come a long way since my earlier experience. For instance, Steam in combination with [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/) allowed for many games to be played on Linux now.

For some time I used the pre-installed TuxedoOS, but then curiousity got me.

## Distro hopping and landing on Manjaro {#distro-hopping-and-landing-on-manjaro}

I tried Mint, Kubuntu, and eventually made my way to the Arch-based Manjaro. My journey taught me a lot about computers, like "What is a kernel?" or "What is a package manager?".

At the time of writing, I use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) with a combination of KDE as the desktop manager and qtile as a window manager.

## The little things... {#the-little-things-dot-dot-dot}

What I absolutely love about my setup is that I can customize it however I want. While it is time consuming and sometimes frustrating, I find that in the end I get rewarded not only by a feeling of accomplishment, but also by a sleek and well-fitted computing experience.

Linux offers many advantages and once one becomes familiar with them, they can be leveraged to great effect. For example, I have all my `dotfiles` (configs for `rofi`, `qtile`, `zsh`, `doom`) in one repository with systemlinks to their appropriate config folders. This way I have a central point for my system config, can easily back it up and deploy it on other machines. Powered by open source tools.
