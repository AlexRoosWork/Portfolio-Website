## IDEs I have used {#ides-i-have-used}

When I started to code with [Python]({{< relref "learn2code" >}}), my first IDE was [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). In contrast to the clunky Java IDE I had tried to install early on when I tried to [.#learn2code]({{< relref "learn2code" >}}), PyCharm was easy to use and looked good, too!

Nevertheless, I then switched to [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (basically VSCode, minus the telemetry), because of recommendations from friends.

## Doom {#doom}

But then, in March of 2020, I was recommended [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). This lead me down the Emacs rabbit hole: learning all the different key chords, tools, workflows and even a little elisp.

Doom takes a central place in my personal setup now and I use it for all kinds of purposes:

- [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) to organise thoughts and write blogs such as this.
- [tramp](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode) to ssh into remote machines and edit files within Doom.
- [magit](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit) to interact with git repos
- [dired](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode) to manage files
- the different language modes as my IDE (mostly Python, JavaScript and HTML)
