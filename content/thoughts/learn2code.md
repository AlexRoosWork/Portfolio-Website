## My HelloWorld Experience {#my-helloworld-experience}

Growing up, I have always been interested in computers. My passion was mostly playing computer games, and as long as everything was working, I did not look under the hood.

## Java {#java}

When I was 13 or so, my father gave a "Java 6 for Dummies" book to me. I tried it, but the setup process of the IDE in Windows was too cumbersome for me and I gave up. The syntax was not looking welcoming either ("How do create these curly braces again?!").

## Ruby {#ruby}

While doing an internship in 2016 at a Berlin start-up, I got fascinated by the idea of writing code again. This time I picked up Ruby on Rails and went through an online course by [TeamTreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). Ruby showed me that the syntax did not have to complex, but I was lacking a usecase to practise.
Also, my general knowledge of computers was lacking and doing everything around the actual code writing threw me off again.

## Python {#python}

During my time as a journalist at [BTC-ECHO](https://www.btc-echo.de/author/alexander-roos/) in 2018, I was learning a lot about cryptocurrencies and the tech space in general. The idea started to grow, that instead of simply sitting on the sidelines and reporting on the developments, I could be a part of the community of people "actually doing something".
This time I did some research first: What languages are in demand? What's a good computer language to start with? The answer was [Python](#python).

## Getting comfortable with computers {#getting-comfortable-with-computers}

So I took the #learn2code hashtag to heart and started teaching myself to code.

Soon after, towards the end of 2019, I ditched my MacBook Pro for a [GNU/Linux]({{< relref "linux" >}}) machine. Gradually, I familiarised myself with the UNIX system and philosophy.

A big step was working through the book "[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)", since it provided an immediate use-case for my everyday life.

## What has kept me going {#what-has-kept-me-going}

As any beginning programmer may attest to: there are moments, where the program just won't work. Hours upon hours are spent looking through StackOverflow, until suddenly: it works.
This feeling of overcoming the struggle, and making something work has kept me hooked on writing code.
