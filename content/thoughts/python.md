## Falling in love with programming {#falling-in-love-with-programming}

Python was the first computer language that I studied seriously. Over time I have fallen in love with the Zen of Python and learned a lot about broader principles of coding.

As I mentioned in [.#learn2code]({{< relref "learn2code" >}}), Python provides me actual utility. Early on I wrote a program to track my hours invested in learning the language. Another one scraped a lyrics website and copied the lyrics into my iTunes library.

## Learning to use framworks and read documentation {#learning-to-use-framworks-and-read-documentation}

Since the syntax of Python is fairly easy, I was able to focus on related skills. For instance I worked on a site with Django. In another project I used Flask and was able to contrast the differences and similarities.

Using any framework or module for that matter, requires reading and <span class="underline">understanding</span> the documentation. This is a skill that I have developed greatly over the almost 2 years of teaching myself to code.

With the many modules Python has to offer, I was able to boost my own skills and developed several Telegram bots. My proudest achievement in this regard would be a bot, that allows group users to up- and downvote the messages of other group members. Read more about it here. {ENTER LINK}

## Customizing my desktop using Python {#customizing-my-desktop-using-python}

Nowadays, Python is my most comfortable language. Its functionality even comes into use on my own desktop. On my journey with tiling window managers, and after much frustration with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/), I discovered [qtile](http://www.qtile.org/).

It is written in Python, and the configuration is also a `.py` file. This means that I can write my own functions to feed the top bar widgets.

For instance, the price of Monero and Bitcoin are API calls to [Coinpaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/#operation/getTickers). They refresh every 60 seconds.

This is just one example of the many benefits, I draw from Python in my own environment.
