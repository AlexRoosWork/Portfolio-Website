TipXMR is by far the biggest and most complex project I have worked on so far. It all started small, in September of 2020 with the idea to support [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) donations in livestreams.

Monero is the biggest privacy focused cryptocurrency in the world and a favorite of mine. The goal was to empower streamers to be less dependant on centralized services like YouTube or Twitch and to expand the use-case for Monero. TipXMR is a non-custodial online service, that uses the Monero Web Assembly Wallet, to provide the user a full-feature crypto wallet in their browser.

## Growing complexity {#growing-complexity}

Just recently before I started on TipXMR with [@hundehausen](https://github.com/hundehausen), I had began with JavaScript and React. Therefore the beginning was quite challenging in setting up webpack and other configurations. Fortunately we had help by a professional software engineer.

Over the months, the deeper we got into it, the complexer the program got. Especially once we discovered what kind of data we wanted to store and how.

Along the way, we also did a [crowdfunding campaign](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/tipxmr.live.html) and collected 72 XMR (about 13,5k EUR).

Recently, we switched out the tech stack to include TypeScript, Redux, Ant Design and PostgreSQL, as you can [read here](https://tipxmr.live/posts/changing-the-tech-stack/).

What truly astonishes me is the possibilites for modern web developer. While standing on the shoulders of giants, we can create innovative applications that empower users!

## This is what I want to do! {#this-is-what-i-want-to-do}

My experience with TipXMR has shown me clearly: **Coding is the profession for me**. I especially enjoyed working in a team with more advanced developers. It is a stark contrast to my early days of a lone keyboard warrior and I noticed that I learn much faster, when I am thrown in the water.

I have learned so much about JavaScript, React, Hooks, Statemanagement, structuring data, interaction with databases and many other small things. Moreover, we also implemented a professional workflow with `git` and `jira` (canban style board). This way TipXMR is training me to be a good team developer, who is comfortable with version control.

TipXMR is still not finished, but we aim to complete it within 2021.
