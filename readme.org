#+TITLE: Alex Roos Portfolio Website

** About
Here you can find the source code for my portfolio website. I used the static site generator [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] along with the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/][Terminal theme]]. The source for the site is actually a single ~.org~ file that I wrote in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]. The handy package [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] allows me to export the ~.org~ file to markdwon along with attachments into the appropriate directories.

I also made some minor adjustments to the Theme, like centering images or having a breakpoint for my cover image.

The hosting is done on a VPS of mine, where I use [[https://nginx.org/en/][NGINX]] to route the requests into the ~public/~ directory of the Hugo site.

** How I use the setup
Here everything really comes together, the workflow is very fast to edit the site. For this I edit the ~.org~ file on my local machine and with the keychord ~SPC m e H A~ I export it directly into the VPS via [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp]]. Afterwards I just need to ~ssh~ into the VPS, ~rm -rf public/~ and ~hugo~ and voil√†, the changes are live.
